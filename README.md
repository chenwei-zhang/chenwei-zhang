🔭 I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). 

👨‍💻 I am currently doing my internship at [Amgen Canada](https://www.amgen.ca/) as a machine learning engineer for drug delivery.

🌱 My research interests lie in employing **machine/deep learning** to solve biophysical problems, especially in protein atomic model building and DNA reaction kinetics. 

📫 If you are interested in my work, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:cwzhang@cs.ubc.ca).
